# Installation
The DisStreamChat website is built with react so it is quite easy to run a development server with webpack   
These are the steps you will need to take to install it
1. Clone The Repo   
    you can see the cloning/download options if you click the button on the main page labelled `Clone or Download` or you can clone it directly with `git clone https://github.com/DisStreamChat/Website.git`
2. cd into the Repo Directory   
    cd into the directory with `cd Website`. If you named the repo something else when you cloned it you will need to `cd` into the folder with that name
3. Install npm dependencies   
    You can install npm dependencies with `npm i` or `npm install`
4. Add your environment variables   
    You will need to create a `.env` file for your environment variables
    the environment variables you will need are shown in the `.env.sample` file in the repo. 
5. Start up a development server   
    Start it up with `npm start`
